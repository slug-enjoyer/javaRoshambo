//This script should play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors
//(or Roshambo) through the console. It will need a function
//to run the computers choice, which will be decided with a
//random number. The computer choice should be assigned to a 
//variable called "compChoice". The user will then input their
//decision, which will then be assigned to a variable called
//"userChoice". We could send the user choice thru a function
//to uniformize it, so that it can be referenced later when
//the game runs the two choices against each other.
//The other choice is to make the game part more robust. 
//I think I would rather have it uniformed.
//Finally, the script will need to output the result,
//utilizing another function that inputs the result 
//into a template literal.
